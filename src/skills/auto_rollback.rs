//! Auto-rollback for regressed skill revisions (step 6f-B).
//!
//! [`crate::skills::EffectivenessCache::regression_candidates`] surfaces
//! skills whose freshly-published revision is performing materially
//! worse than its predecessor.  This module is the consumer of those
//! signals: it owns the per-skill cooldown so we don't ping-pong a
//! revision in and out of `published`, and it dispatches the actual
//! Kumiho call via [`crate::skills::registration::rollback_skill_revision`].
//!
//! Gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "skill-creation")]` to mirror the
//! improvement path.
//!
//! ## Cooldown semantics
//!
//! Every successful rollback arms a cooldown for the affected skill.
//! Subsequent regression candidates for the same skill are skipped
//! until the cooldown expires.  The cooldown is **separate** from
//! `SkillImprover`'s improvement cooldown: a rollback of skill A does
//! not delay a future improvement of skill A, and vice versa.  The
//! safety net against re-improving a known-bad skill comes from the
//! improvement cooldown that was already armed when the (now
//! regressed) revision was first published.
//!
//! ## Why the rollback target tag matters
//!
//! `rollback_skill_revision` requires the skill to have a
//! `previous_published` revision tagged in Kumiho.  That tag is set
//! by `publish_skill_revision` (step 6f-A).  A skill that has only
//! ever had one published revision can't be rolled back — the
//! tracker handles this by returning `Ok(None)` when the underlying
//! call fails for that reason, since it's an expected pre-condition
//! rather than a runtime error.
