//! Daemon-level effectiveness cache.
//!
//! Step 4 of the self-improving agent plan.  Backs the read side of
//! `record_skill_outcome` from PR #23 with a process-wide cache the
//! prompt builder can query synchronously while building each agent's
//! system prompt.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! Per the operator-side handler in PR #23, each successful or failed
//! skill use is recorded under
//! `<memory_project>/Skills/<skill>/Outcomes/` with the outcome's slug
//! prefixed by `ok-` (success) or `fail-` (failure).  This cache lists
//! those items via [`KumihoClient::list_items`], classifies each by the
//! prefix, and stores `(rate, total)` per skill.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! The cache is `Arc<EffectivenessCache>`-shareable and uses an internal
//! `RwLock` so the prompt builder can read scores without blocking the
//! background refresh task.  Refreshes are coalesced — multiple concurrent
//! callers of `refresh_for_skills` overlap their work but only the latest
//! snapshot is published.
