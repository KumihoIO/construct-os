//! Register an installed skill with Kumiho.
//!
//! Step 6b of the self-improving skill plan.  This module exposes the
//! single canonical "this skill exists, give it a Kumiho identity"
//! operation that step 6c will route every install path through —
//! ClawHub, GitHub link, dashboard, `creator.rs`, daemon-startup scan,
//! the operator's `capture_skill` MCP tool.
//!
//! ## What `register_skill_with_kumiho` does
//!
//! Given a skill directory on disk (`~/.construct/workspace/skills/<slug>/`)
//! and a Kumiho client + memory_project name from config:
//!
//! 1. **No-op if already registered** — when the skill's `SKILL.toml`
//!    already has `[skill].kref` set, the existing kref is returned.
//!    This is what makes the function safe to call from every install
//!    path including a daemon-startup scan: re-registering a skill that
//!    was registered yesterday costs zero Kumiho calls.
//!
//! 2. **Auto-migrate legacy embedded prompts** to a content file.  The
//!    [`super::migrate_skill_toml_to_content_file`] helper added in step
//!    6a runs first when the manifest is still in legacy form, so the
//!    revision's artifact has a stable file path to point at.
//!
//! 3. **Resolve the absolute content file path** the artifact will
//!    reference.  Kumiho stores the kref → file location mapping; the
//!    file itself stays canonical on disk.
//!
//! 4. **Create item + revision + artifact + tag** in
//!    `<memory_project>/Skills/`:
//!      - `create_item(kind = "skilldef", item_name = slug)`
//!      - `create_revision(item_kref, metadata)` with manifest fields
//!      - `create_artifact(revision_kref, name = "skill", location = "file://<abs>")`
//!      - `tag_revision(revision_kref, "published")`
//!
//! 5. **Rewrite `SKILL.toml`** with `[skill].kref =
//!    "kref://<memory_project>/Skills/<slug>.skilldef?t=published"`.
//!    The `?t=published` query is what makes the manifest write-once
//!    across revisions: subsequent improvements that retag `published`
//!    onto a new revision are picked up automatically without touching
//!    the manifest again.
//!
//! ## Error handling
//!
//! Any Kumiho-side failure leaves the file system in its starting state
//! — the manifest is only rewritten after every Kumiho call has
//! succeeded, so a partial registration cannot end up with a kref
//! pointing at a non-existent revision.
