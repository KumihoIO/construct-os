"""Durable workflow recovery — resume interrupted runs after operator restart.

On operator process restart, any in-flight workflow execution is lost because
`execute_workflow()` runs as an asyncio coroutine in-memory.  However:

  - Step results are persisted to Kumiho after each step completes.
  - Sidecar agents may still be alive (they outlive the operator process).
  - `execute_workflow()` accepts `resume_state` to skip completed steps.

This module bridges the gap:

  1. Finds runs stuck in "running" state via Kumiho.
  2. Probes the sidecar for surviving agents (matched by title convention
     `wf-{run_id[:8]}-{step_id}`).
  3. Harvests output from completed/idle agents; waits briefly for still-running
     agents; marks dead agents' steps as failed.
  4. Builds a WorkflowState with pre-populated step_results and calls
     execute_workflow(resume_state=state) as a background task.

Uses a file lock (~/.construct/recovery.lock) so only one operator process
performs recovery even when multiple processes start simultaneously.
