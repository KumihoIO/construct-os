# Generate a self-signed code-signing certificate for Construct's Windows binaries.
#
# Run this ONCE on a Windows machine. The script prints two values:
#   WIN_SIGNING_PFX_BASE64
#   WIN_SIGNING_PFX_PASSWORD
# Add both to the GitHub repository secrets. The release workflows will then
# sign construct.exe with this certificate on every Windows build.
#
# Certificate validity: 5 years. Re-run this script before expiry.
# Self-signed certs trigger "Unknown Publisher" on first run — this is expected
# until we obtain an EV code-signing certificate (future upgrade).
